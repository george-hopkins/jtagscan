general:
========
- monitor pins for changing ones (with pullups on)
- get High impedance pins first by disabling the pullups?
- look for changing pins with pullups on/off
- and those which aren't changes by the pullups! (100k -> nRST?)
- try Lo pins for nRST first, Hi pins for TMS/TCK/TDI (with pullups on)

circuit board:
==============
- maybe with 3.3 and 5V suooprt?
- USB connector, pl2303 or so integrated?

AVR:
====
- shift TMS and TDI + get TDO support (openwince-jtag package)
- ATmega32L at 7.x MHz
- firmware update + show version support?

GTK code:
=========
- show low pins
- IO entry field
- RST support
- retry on timeout
- IDCODE support?
- openwince-jtag backend?
